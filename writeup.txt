-------- MULTIPART FORM STRUCTURE ----------
I would like a few aspects of gamificaiton implemented in this review form. 

First name, last name, email and Data privacy and consent should be the final part of the form to fill out

Otherwise, the form questions should be in order listed above, each question being a single step to the multi-part form.

Data submissions should be sent to the same hubspot form for now - will update criteria once you've made it this far.
